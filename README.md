# Game List Frontend

A simple React.js App that uses Axios and TailwindCSS.  
No fancy UI libraries.

### Setup Instructions (Quick)
 - create a .env file at the root level with entry: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=YourBackendURLGoesHere`
 - `npm install` to download dependencies
 - `npm run start` to run the dev server

### Build Instructions
 - `npm install` to download dependencies
 - `npm run build` to generate static files

### Developer After-Thoughts
1. Trying to make this look nice was far more difficult than implementing the functionality.  

2. I should have started with the Create component instead of the Item component. This meant that the state was stored in the wrong component and the way I refresh the data is not very good.

3. React is easier and more fun to use than I remember.
